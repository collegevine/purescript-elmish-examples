# TodoMVC example

This example conforms to the spec of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), a popular comparison of UI libraries and frameworks.

While Elmish cannot be actually submitted to be one of the official TodoMVC examples (not popular enough; the requirement is 5000 stars on GitHub), it's still a good example that can be used for demonstration and education purposes. Perhaps some day :-)

## Building and running

* To initialize: `npm install`
* To build: `npm run build`
* To start a dev server with autoreloading changes: `npm start`
